      Secret family recipes, those lovingly written note cards that grandma left tied in a stack, or scribbled in little notebooks, bring back memories of Thanksgiving at grandma's, Sunday dinners and time spent together.
      
      But books and cards can be easily misplaced, damaged by unfortunate cooking mishaps, or lost to the wearing and fading of time. Protect your treasured recipes for generations to come, digitally.
